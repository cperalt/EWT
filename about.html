    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>Founded in 2015, our organization is dedicated to empowering women in the tech industry and promoting gender diversity and equality in the rapidly evolving world of technology. We believe that diversity fuels innovation, and by empowering women, we can unlock the full potential of the tech sector.</p>

<div id="our-why">
    <h3>Our Why</h3>
    <p>At our core, we are driven by a simple yet powerful belief: that every woman deserves an equal opportunity to succeed in the tech industry. We recognize the systemic barriers and biases that have historically hindered women's progress in technology and are committed to addressing them head-on. Our why is rooted in the conviction that a more diverse and inclusive tech industry benefits everyoneâ€”driving innovation, fostering creativity, and creating a more equitable society.</p>
    <p>However, we also acknowledge the reality that men often have more opportunity and representation within the tech industry. This imbalance not only perpetuates inequalities but also limits the industry's potential for growth and innovation.</p>
    <p>Since our inception, we have been dedicated to creating a supportive and inclusive community where women can thrive professionally and personally. Through a range of initiatives, programs, and resources, we strive to provide women with the tools, support, and opportunities they need to excel in their tech careers.</p>
