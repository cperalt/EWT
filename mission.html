            <h1 class="vision-titles">Our Story: Empowering Women in Tech -</h1>
            <p class="vision-para"><strong class="para-titles-odd">Founding Vision:</strong> Empowering Women in Tech® was founded in 2015 with a bold vision: to dismantle barriers and empower women to thrive in the technology industry. Inspired by a passion for equality and fueled by a desire to drive change, our founders set out on a mission to create a more inclusive and diverse tech ecosystem.</p>
            <p class="vision-para"><strong class="para-titles-even">Year 1:</strong> In our first year, EWT operated as a grassroots movement, driven by the belief that every woman deserves the opportunity to pursue a career in tech. With limited resources but boundless determination, we began laying the groundwork for what would become a thriving community of empowered women.</p>
            <p class="vision-para"><strong class="para-titles-odd">Milestones and Growth:</strong> As our organization grew, so too did our impact. We celebrated milestones, from the launch of our first mentorship program to the expansion of our outreach efforts. Each achievement fueled our momentum and reinforced our commitment to breaking down barriers and fostering inclusion in tech.</p>
            <p class="vision-para"><strong class="para-titles-even">Navigating Challenges:</strong> Our journey has not been without challenges. We've faced obstacles and setbacks along the way, but each challenge has only strengthened our resolve. We've learned and grown from our experiences, emerging more resilient and determined than ever to create meaningful change.</p>
            <p class="vision-para"><strong class="para-titles-odd">Impact and Influence:</strong> Today, EWT stands as a beacon of hope and opportunity for women in tech. Our programs and initiatives have touched the lives of countless women, providing them with the support, resources, and encouragement they need to succeed in a male-dominated industry.</p>
            <p class="vision-para"><strong class="para-titles-even">Looking to the Future:</strong> As we look ahead, we see endless possibilities. We envision a future where women are equally represented and valued in all areas of technology. We remain committed to our founding principles and inspired by the potential for even greater impact in the years to come.</p>
            <img src="images/EWT Vision.png" class="vision-image">
            <h1 class="vision-titles">Why?</h1>
            <p class="vision-para">At our core, we are driven by a simple yet powerful belief: that every woman deserves an equal opportunity to succeed in the tech industry. We recognize the systemic barriers and biases that have historically hindered women's progress in technology and are committed to addressing them head-on. Our why is rooted in the conviction that a more diverse and inclusive tech industry benefits everyone—driving innovation, fostering creativity, and creating a more equitable society.</p>
            <p class="vision-para">However, we also acknowledge the reality that men often have more opportunity and representation within the tech industry. This imbalance not only perpetuates inequalities but also limits the industry's potential for growth and innovation.</p>
            <p class="vision-para">Since our inception, we have been dedicated to creating a supportive and inclusive community where women can thrive professionally and personally. Through a range of initiatives, programs, and resources, we strive to provide women with the tools, support, and opportunities they need to excel in their tech careers.</p>

            <h1 class="vision-titles">How? -</h1>
            <p class="vision-para"><strong class="para-titles-odd">Mentorship Programs:</strong> We pair experienced professionals with aspiring women in tech to provide guidance, support, and invaluable industry insights.</p>
            <p class="vision-para"><strong class="para-titles-even">Skill-Building Workshops:</strong> From coding bootcamps to leadership development seminars, our workshops equip women with the technical and soft skills necessary for success in the tech industry.</p>
            <p class="vision-para"><strong class="para-titles-odd">Networking Events:</strong> We host regular networking opportunities where women can connect with peers, mentors, and potential employers, fostering valuable relationships and professional connections.</p>
            <p class="vision-para"><strong class="para-titles-even">Educational Scholarships:</strong> We believe in breaking down barriers to entry in STEM fields. Through our scholarship programs, we provide financial support to women pursuing education and training in technology-related disciplines.</p>
            <p class="vision-para"><strong class="para-titles-odd">Resource Hub:</strong> Our online resource hub offers a wealth of tools, articles, and guides to support women at every stage of their tech journey, from exploring career paths to navigating workplace challenges.</p>
            <p class="vision-para"><strong class="para-titles-even">Community Support:</strong> We cultivate a vibrant and inclusive community where women can share experiences, celebrate achievements, and seek advice in a safe and supportive environment.</p>
